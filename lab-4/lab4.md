# Lab 4: Creating a RAG Pipeline from File Uploads

In this lab, you will build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using Vectorize. You‚Äôll upload datasheet PDFs as your source data, chunk and embed them, and deploy your pipeline to enable real-time retrieval.

## üìÅ Prerequisites

Before you begin:

1. Clone the workshop repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:vectorize-io/rag-101-workshop.git
   cd rag-101-workshop
   ```

2. Ensure you have access to [platform.vectorize.io](https://platform.vectorize.io) with an active organization account.

### Step 7: Configure the Extractor

Set the extraction strategy to **Fast**, the chunking strategy to **Paragraph**, chunk size to `500` tokens, and overlap to `50`.

## ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Next?

Once deployed, your pipeline is ready to perform RAG queries. You can now:

- Test retrieval using the **RAG Evaluations** tab.
- Add metadata extraction with **Iris**.
- Iterate on chunking, embedding, and source selection for optimal results.

## üß™ Lab Summary

In this lab, you:

- Created a new RAG pipeline.
- Connected a file upload source with PDF datasheets.
- Configured chunking, embedding, and vector storage.
- Deployed a working RAG pipeline.

You're now ready to build more advanced retrieval workflows!
